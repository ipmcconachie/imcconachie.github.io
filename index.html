							<p>
								I grew up in the East Bay Area of California, where I developed an early passion for astronomy from frequent camping and stargazing trips to Yosemite and the Sierras with my dad. I received my undergraduate B.S. degree in physics, with an emphasis in astrophysics, and a minor in mathenmatics from University of California, Davis, where I was actively involved in the physics club and Physics Department outreach programs. 
							<p>
								<!-- Items contained in <b> tags are bolded! -->
								I moved down to sunny southern California for graduate school at the University of California, Riverside. For my Ph.D., I worked with Prof. Gillian Wilson and the Massive Ancient Galaxies At z>3 NEar-infrared (MAGAZ3NE) collaboration, leading projects related to ultra-massive galaxies and their environments. I received my Ph.D. in physics in December 2023, with my dissertation "Ultra-massive Galaxies in Galaxy Protoclusters at z>3."
							</p>
							<p>
								In early 2024, I taught a course in calculus-based classical mechanics at Riverside City College.
